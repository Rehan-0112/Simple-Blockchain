# ⛓️ Simple Blockchain in Python

This is my **first project** — a simple blockchain implementation written in Python.  
It demonstrates the basic concepts of how a blockchain works, including blocks, hashing, proof-of-work, and chain validation.

---

## 🚀 Features
- Create a blockchain with a **genesis block**
- Add new blocks containing transactions
- Use **SHA-256 hashing** for block security
- Implement a simple **proof-of-work (mining) algorithm**
- Verify the integrity of the entire chain

---

## 🛠️ Requirements
- Python 3.x  
- Built-in libraries only (`hashlib`, `json`, `time`)
