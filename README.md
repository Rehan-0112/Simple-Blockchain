# üìå Crypto Wallet Simulator

A simple Crypto Wallet Simulator built in Python.  
This project demonstrates how digital wallets and transactions work using a JSON-based ledger.

Each wallet has a unique address, balance, and can transfer coins to other wallets.  
All transactions are permanently recorded in `transactions.json`, while wallet details are saved in `wallets.json`.
